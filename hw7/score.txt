##!! in line 111 you have
##!! speeches[breaks[i] + 6:breaks[i+1] - 1]
##!! but you want speeches[(breaks[i] + 6):(breaks[i+1] - 1)]
##!! this is because 2-1:3-1 is not the same as (2-1):(3-1).
##!! As a result your speeches are split in the wrong locations.
Is presidentWordMat reasonable? 1/2
##!! There is an off by one error in the construction of presidents;
##!! it has last entry NA, so the presidentWordMat code breaks.
